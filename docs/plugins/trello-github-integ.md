# trello-github-integ Plugin

This plugin creates a new GitHub Actions workflow(trello-github-integration) and uploads it to your GitHub repo.

## Usage

This plugin depends on and can be used together with the `trello` plugin (see document [here](./trello.md)).

`trello-github-integ` plugin can also use `trello` plugin's outputs as input. See the example below:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: my-trello-board
    # name of the plugin
    plugin: trello
    # optional; if specified, dtm will make sure the dependency is applied first before handling this tool
    dependsOn: [ "TOOL1_NAME.TOOL1_PLUGIN", "TOOL2_NAME.TOOL2_PLUGIN" ]
    # options for the plugin
    options:
      # the repo's owner
      owner: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
      # the repo's org. If you set this property, then the new repo will be created under the org you're given, and the "owner" setting above will be ignored.
      org: YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME
      # for which repo this board will be used
      repo: YOUR_REPO_NAME
      # the Tello board name. If empty, use owner/repo as the board's name.
      kanbanBoardName: KANBAN_BOARD_NAME
  - name: trello-github
    # name of the plugin
    plugin: trello-github-integ
    # optional; if specified, dtm will make sure the dependency is applied first before handling this tool.
    dependsOn: [ "TRELLO_TOOL_NAME.trello" ]
    # options for the plugin
    options:
      # the repo's owner. It should be case-sensitive here; strictly use your GitHub user name; please change the value below.
      owner: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
      # the repo where you'd like to setup GitHub Actions; please change the value below.
      # the repo's org. If you set this property, then the new repo will be created under the org you're given, and the "owner" setting above will be ignored.
      org: YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME
      repo: YOUR_REPO_NAME
      # reference parameters come from dependency, their usage will be explained later
      boardId: ${{ TRELLO_TOOL_NAME.trello.outputs.boardId }}
      todoListId: ${{ TRELLO_TOOL_NAME.trello.outputs.todoListId }}
      doingListId: ${{ TRELLO_TOOL_NAME.trello.outputs.doingListId }}
      doneListId: ${{ TRELLO_TOOL_NAME.trello.outputs.doneListId }}
      # main branch of the repo (to which branch the plugin will submit the workflows)
      branch: main
```

Replace the following from the config above:

- `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- `KANBAN_BOARD_NAME`

In the example above:

- We create a Trello board using `trello` plugin, and the board is marked to be used for repo YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.
- `trello-github-integ` plugin depends on `trello` plugin, because we use `trello` plugin's outputs as the input for the `trello-github-integ` plugin.

Pay attention to the `${{ xxx }}` part in the example. `${{ TOOL_NAME.PLUGIN.outputs.var}}` is the syntax for using an output.
